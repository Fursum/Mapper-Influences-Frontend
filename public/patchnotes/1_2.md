# Map Search and Mentions!

We have a shiny map search interface! Also the influence counts are now visible. 👍

It will now auto populate the search bar with the user you are looking at. You don't have to leave the site to find the maps you are looking for. 🤯
Here is a sneak peek:

Also earlier today we've had a problem with the database migration and reset all of the data. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
We apologize to the early testers. We will be looking to implement backups for any similar issues.
