# Launch Day!

Welcome everybody! Hopefully we have a smooth launch.

The invite (spam) process will be started shortly to be able to supply some initial data for the site.

Below you can see our plans to improve the site. If you have more suggestions, you can join our Discord or just shoot me a message on osu!

## ðŸ’¥ **Features on short notice**

ðŸ‘‰ **Mentions**: The tab will be added to showcase the people who added you. You can also look at other people's mentions as well.

ðŸ‘‰ **Maps in Influences**: We currently support adding maps to individual influence rows. However the there is no way to add them from the site. (yet!)

## ðŸ¤” **Planned features**

ðŸ‘‰ **Activity feed**: A feed is needed to have a reason to occasionally visit the site. Currently there is not much else to do other than setup your profile. ðŸ˜¢

ðŸ‘‰ **Draggable influences**: Changing the order of influences is pretty important (atleast to me). However it might take a bit of work to get it right.

ðŸ‘‰ **Banners**: I would like to auto generate some banners to display them on your osu! profile.

ðŸ‘‰ **Map leaderboards**: This does not seem immediately useful since there are better to rank maps ([omdb](https://omdb.nyahh.net/)).

ðŸ‘‰ **General stats**: Stats like how many users have been registered and how many connections there are. They are nice to look at but not as important as other features.
