# Better Map Search and Influence Sorting!

Dear mappers and players, we have a new big update! Much requested influence sorting and map filters are now here.  
We also added support for leaderboard filtering but it needs its own page to be able to properly utilize these filters. For now, it only supports ranked mappers and your country.
